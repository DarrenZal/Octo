# Gorge Creek Herring Monitoring

Community volunteers monitor herring spawning events along the Gorge Waterway in Greater Victoria. The Gorge Waterway is one of the few urban waterways in the Salish Sea where herring still spawn regularly.

Monitoring involves recording spawn timing, location along the waterway, egg density on substrate (kelp, eelgrass, pilings), and water temperature. Data is shared with DFO and local conservation groups.

The practice connects urban residents directly to the marine ecosystem flowing through their neighborhoods — making the invisible visible.
