# Front Range

The Colorado Front Range bioregion spans the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, encompassing the urban corridor from Fort Collins through Denver to Pueblo and the surrounding foothills, plains, and watersheds.

This is the traditional homeland of the Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Ute peoples. The bioregion is defined by the transition from alpine and subalpine ecosystems through montane forests and foothills shrublands to high plains grasslands.

Key ecological features include the South Platte and Arkansas River watersheds, Rocky Mountain foothills wildfire zones, shortgrass and mixed-grass prairies, and the rapidly growing Front Range urban corridor that puts increasing pressure on water resources and wildlife habitat.

As a peer node in the Bioregional Knowledge Commons, the Front Range contributes place-specific knowledge from a different ecological and social context than the Pacific Northwest nodes, enabling cross-bioregional pattern discovery.
