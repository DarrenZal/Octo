# High Plains Prairie Restoration

The shortgrass and mixed-grass prairies east of the Front Range are among the most endangered ecosystems in North America — less than 2% of original tallgrass prairie remains on the continent. Along the Front Range, remaining prairie fragments face pressure from urban sprawl, agricultural conversion, and invasive species.

Restoration practices include native seed collection and propagation, conservation easements on ranchlands, regenerative grazing management that mimics historic bison patterns, and removal of invasive cheatgrass. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge demonstrates successful prairie restoration at scale, with reintroduced bison herds serving as ecological engineers.
