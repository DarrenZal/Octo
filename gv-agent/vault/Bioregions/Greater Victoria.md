# Greater Victoria

Greater Victoria is a sub-bioregion of the Salish Sea, encompassing the southern tip of Vancouver Island. It sits on the traditional lands of the Lək̓ʷəŋən (Songhees and Esquimalt) and W̱SÁNEĆ peoples.

Key ecological features include the Gorge Waterway (herring spawning), Goldstream River (salmon spawning), Beacon Hill (camas meadows), and the coastal marine ecosystems of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

As one of Octo's leaf nodes, Greater Victoria contributes place-specific knowledge that aggregates into Salish Sea-wide patterns.
