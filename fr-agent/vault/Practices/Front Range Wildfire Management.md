# Front Range Wildfire Management

The wildland-urban interface along the Front Range foothills is one of the highest wildfire risk zones in the American West. The Marshall Fire (2021) demonstrated the vulnerability of Front Range communities, destroying over 1,000 homes.

Community-based mitigation practices include defensible space programs, prescribed fire reintroduction, forest thinning partnerships between municipalities and the USFS, and FireWise community certification. Indigenous fire stewardship knowledge — particularly Ute practices of landscape-scale burning — is being integrated into modern management approaches through collaborative research partnerships.
