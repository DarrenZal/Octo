# South Platte Water Conservation

The South Platte River is the lifeline of the Colorado Front Range — supplying water to Denver, agriculture on the eastern plains, and downstream users in Nebraska. As climate change reduces snowpack and population growth increases demand, collaborative conservation has become essential.

Practices include deficit irrigation strategies, aquifer recharge projects, municipal xeriscape programs, and inter-basin cooperation agreements. Indigenous water knowledge from Arapaho and Cheyenne traditions offers long-term perspectives on drought cycles and watershed health that complement Western hydrological models.
