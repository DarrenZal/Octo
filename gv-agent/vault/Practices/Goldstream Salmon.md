# Goldstream Salmon Observation

Every fall, thousands of chum salmon return to Goldstream River in Goldstream Provincial Park to spawn. Community volunteers and park naturalists count returning fish, record spawning behavior, and educate visitors.

The Goldstream salmon run is one of Greater Victoria's most visible ecological events — drawing thousands of visitors annually and serving as a gateway to watershed awareness. Eagles, bears, and marine nutrients all flow through this single practice of observation.

The practice demonstrates how monitoring becomes community-building — the act of watching together creates shared investment in the watershed's health.
