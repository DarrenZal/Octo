# Beacon Hill Camas Restoration

Camas meadows were once a defining feature of the Greater Victoria landscape — tended by Lək̓ʷəŋən peoples for thousands of years through controlled burning and careful harvest. Beacon Hill Park still contains remnant camas populations.

Restoration efforts focus on removing invasive species (particularly Scotch broom and English ivy), reintroducing controlled burns where feasible, and expanding camas habitat. The work is done in partnership with Lək̓ʷəŋən knowledge holders who carry the traditional ecological knowledge of camas cultivation.

This practice sits at the intersection of ecological restoration, Indigenous food sovereignty, and urban land management — demonstrating that even in a city, bioregional practices can be revived.
